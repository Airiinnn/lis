## Personal Portfolio Website (Work in progress)

My personal programming portfolio website made with React.

Focuses of this personal project:
1. Familiarise myself with React
2. Be conscious of UX when designing the UI
3. Create a responsive web design that looks good on all devices
4. Gain additional experience in front-end development
